# Activities

All of the activities below are designed to be done with the [radio drama scenario](https://github.com/seanluyk/audio101/blob/master/exercises_intro.md#scenario) described, but are easily adaptable to your own projects:

## 1.0 Basic Audio Editing Using Audacity
### 1.1 Watch an introductory tutorial (optional)
- [Audacity: Complete Tutorial Guide to Audacity for Beginners / David Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCisC3sHneM)
### 1.2 Clean up and segment your recordings
- Locate the program introductions (advertisements, program introduction, sound effects, music, etc.) and copy them to new tracks (1 for each program). Add descriptive labels
- Remove the program closing (advertisements, credits, sound effects, music, etc.) and copy to them a new tracks (1 for each program). Add descriptive labels
- At this point you should have 6 tracks:
  - Dimension X Introduction
  - X Minus One Introduction
  - Dimension X Closing
  - X Minus One Closing
  - Dimension X Story
  - X Minus One Story
- Remove unnecessary silence at the beginning and end of each of your tracks track (hint: zoom is your best friend!), but keep some as to avoid awkward clicks
- Introduce fades at the beginning and end of each track as needed, using the fade in/fade out effects. * Use Brandon Walsh's excellent instructions for how to do this in [Editing Audio with Audacity](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/editing-audio-with-audacity#editing-audio)  
### 1.3 Make clips of the closing line by Captain John Black (quoted below) from each audio recording for the purposes of analysis and comparison: 
> > Listen! Listen! They're trying to break through the hall. Edward and Mom and Dad and all the folks, but they're changing now. They're melting and changing back into... they're Martians! Can you understand? They're Martians, not men! They made us think that Mars was heaven, and we fell into the trap. Can you hear me earth? You've got to stop the next rocket! Listen, tell my brother Will, tell my brother not to come, they'll trap him too. They'll kill them all! Hello! Hello! Can you hear me earth? This is John Black on Mars. Hello Earth! This is John Black on Mars! Hello Earth! Hello Earth! Hello Earth!
- Locate the boundaries of this line in each of your Story tracks
- Copy them to new tracks, and add descriptive labels
- At this point you should have 8 tracks
### 1.4 Listen to each of the closing clips closely and note:
1. Their loudest and softest points (amplitude). How does this correspond to the text? How are their performances the same? How are they different? 
2. Any interesting sonic features? 
3. Repeat this for one of your pairs of clips (optional) 

## 2. Compare Two Recordings Using Sonic Lineup
- Export the Captain John Black closing line clips
  - Mute all but your desired clips for export
  - File>Export Multiple
- Open them up in Sonic Lineup
- Explore the various visualization options available
- Use the speed up/slow down features and toggle between recordings to do some close listening
- For more help using Sonic Lineup, refer to [Sonic Lineup: A Brief Reference](https://sonicvisualiser.org/sonic-lineup/doc/reference/1.0/en/index.html)

## 3. Use the Command Line to Extract Audio Metadata
