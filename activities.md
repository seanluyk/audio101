# Activities

All of the activities below are designed to be done with the [radio drama scenario](https://github.com/seanluyk/audio101/blob/master/exercises_intro.md#scenario) described, but are easily adaptable to your own projects:

## 1. Basic Audio Editing Using Audacity
### 1.1 Clean up and segment your recordings
- Remove the advertisements at the beginning and end of each program and copy to a new track. Add a descriptive label
- Remove the opening sound effects of each program and copy to a new track. Add a descriptive label
- Remove silence at the beginning and end of each track (hint: zoom is your best friend!)
- 
### 1.2 Make clips of the closing line by Captain John Black from each audio recording for the purposes of analysis and comparison: 
> > Listen! Listen! They're trying to break through the hall. Edward and Mom and Dad and all the folks, but they're changing now. They're melting and changing back into... they're Martians! Can you understand? They're Martians, not men! They made us think that Mars was heaven, and we fell into the trap. Can you hear me earth? You've got to stop the next rocket! Listen, tell my brother Will, tell my brother not to come, they'll trap him too. They'll kill them all! Hello! Hello! Can you hear me earth? This is John Black on Mars. Hello Earth! This is John Black on Mars! Hello Earth! Hello Earth! Hello Earth!
### 1.2 Listen to each clip closely and note:
1. Their loudest points (amplitude). How does this correspond to the text? 
2. 


## 2. Compare Two Recordings Using Sonic Lineup

## 3. Use FFMPEG to Extract an Audio Track

## 4. Use the Command Line to Extract Audio Metadata
