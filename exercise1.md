## Comparing the Use of Sound and Music in Science Fiction Radio Dramas
**Credits**
Inspired by and adapted from John F. Barber’s DHSI course on sound in DH, described in [this article](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000239/000239.html)

## **Scenario** 
You’re a scholar of speculative fiction who researches the sonic aspects of early sci-fi radio dramas. You’re doing an analysis of the many versions of ["Mars is Heaven!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Is_Heaven!), written by Ray Bradbury. For an upcoming conference paper, you’d like to present an analysis that compares the use of sound and music in versions of the story from two classic radio drama programs ([Dimension X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_X_(radio_program)), and [X Minus One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Minus_One)) as well as the 1990 [The Ray Bradbury Theatre television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ray_Bradbury_Theater) episode (featuring a young Paul Gross!)
